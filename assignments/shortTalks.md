# Short talks (Extra)

Part of the EXTRA points

**Value**: 4

**Maximum**: Each student can present ONE talk

You can choose a topic related to Open Source to prepare and make a short presentation at the beginning of any lecture. 

[Here you can find an initial list of topics](../shorttalks.md); but you can add anything they find relevant as well. There can be at most TWO presentations per lecture, and it needs to be authorized by the day before the class. The student needs to open an pull request [changing the schedule on GitHub](assignments/shortTalkSchedule.md) proposing the talk at least 24 hours before the class, and the instructor needs to acknowledge, accepting the pull request. This will work in a *First to Come First to Serve* basis.

Submission details to be provided (probably on BBLearn)
