# Assignment: Licensing your code

**GROUP ASSIGNMENT**

**Deadline**: October 4

**How to submit**: BBLearn	

**Value**: 5%



This assignment is a complement of the [previous assignment](assignments/openYourProject.md), and you will have to discuss in your group and decide what would be the license you will apply to the project you just open-sourced. You can follow [Chapter 2 of Fogel's book](https://producingoss.com/en/license-quickstart.html) and seek for more legal details in [Chapter nine](https://producingoss.com/en/legal.html) or take a look at Andrew St. Laurent's book ([Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/osfreesoft/book/index.html)).

"Once you've chosen a license, you'll need to apply it to the software." Go ahead and do it.



Your deliverable will be a report (~half page) justifying why did you choose this specific license for this project instead of the others.
